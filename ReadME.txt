I made this as a prototype for a SENG2260 Human-Computer Interaction. It's meant to simulate the use of an AR headset, 
so holding either shift or space will transfer movement along the mouse axis from controlling the camera rotation (i.e.
looking around) to controlling a virtual 'handâ€™. Clicking with this virtual hand active will simulate a 'gesture', which
in AR would equate to a click, selecting whichever element is being hovered over with the hand. 

See the attached PDF report for more details, and the builds folder for a working build. 

NOTE: the build was only required to run in a demonstration environment, so many quality-of-life improvements were forgone,
such as an options menu and windowed mode.
